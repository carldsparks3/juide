# Juide
Juide is a tool to develop multi-platform desktop applications using your favorite web technologies. It's built using the Java programming language and the JavaFX library. Build UI for your desktop application using the web tech stack of your choice. Serve up dynamic content from the web or point to a local static website. 

### Configure your desktop application using simple JSON

### Extend the web UI with native desktop integrations
Create experiences that feel native to your user's environment with less effort. Integrate your web code with the bundled Java code.
